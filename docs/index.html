                    History of the internet Apple iMac

                    The Apple iMac is a series of personal computers that was massively successful. Likewise, the Apple iMac’s design has changed drastically to meet consumer demands for more powerful and sleeker designs. Semi recently Apple changed the iMac’s design in 2009 and debuted with the “2009”(Apple Support Page Identify Your iMac Model) era which featured an aluminum case design. The primary benefit of the 2009 iMac is that it was a space saving computer because all of the computer components except the keyboard and mouse are inside the display. However, the monitor and the monitor stand are relatively thick. “Depth: 7.4 inches (18.9 cm)”(Apple Support Page Technical Specifications Early 2009 iMac) Despite the iMac’s thickness it would still save space on a desk area than having a monitor and a desktop tower separately. Likewise, later in the future Apple was able to further improve the iMac’s design, but the design was arguably the same because Apple kept the aluminum case design from previous iMacs, but improved the technical specifications. “20-inch and 24-inch model with 2.66GHz processor NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory3.”(Apple Support Page Technical Specifications Early 2009 iMac) and comparing the specifications to the 2020 iMac it is a drastic improvement. “Graphics 3.0GHz Radeon Pro 570X with 4GB of GDDR5 memory 3.0GHz 3.0GHz 6‑core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz)”(Apple Support Page Technical Specifications 2019 iMac) Likewise, improving the technical specs of a personal computer can expand the computer’s functionality with a faster processor and improvement graphics the 2019 iMac can do more tasks that the 2009 iMac cannot. For example, a person can use a 2019 iMac to play ultra high definition games that cannot run with only 256mb of graphics memory. A person can also have more programs simultaneously because the 2019 iMac’s 6 core processor can open more programs without slowing down. Therefore, the Apple iMac is a popular personal computer because it’s improved processing power made it popular for Apple customers and customers that are new to Apple technology.
