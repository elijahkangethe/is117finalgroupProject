      <p class="card-text">
      The internet originated from the ARPANET which was conceptualized and sponsored by the American military to create a nationally accessible communication system.
        Moreover, no single group controls the internet because internet networks can be created by internet service providers and then redistributed to customers.
        Likewise, users can connect to networks or use different providers if they are dissatisfied with their service providers service.
        The internet has many nodes that redistribute internet content to internet users and the internet is beneficial because if one node is removed the entire internet does not vanish because other nodes can serve users the data they would like to access.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="second-card-text"><i>The internet is able to transmit binary information that is interpreted by the computer and then turned into files such as documents, software, and websites to the user. Wired internet communications use cables to transmit information if the connection is removed then the data being transferred is lost.
        Moreover, the computers that want to send and receive information have to recognize the data transfer and then the data is sent into the receiving machine. Moreover, internet speed is affected by the connection’s bandwidth.
        Likewise, bandwidth is affected by the types of cables used when the data is transmitted a standard Ethernet cable can send information moderately fast. Therefore, the internet relies on fiber optic cables that send much faster than Ethernet cables could. Likewise, WIFI works with radio waves that can wirelessly communicate with other devices. WIFI makes using the internet convenient for someone to access information using a mobile device or is in an area without Ethernet access.</i></p>

      <p class="card-text">
      The internet is able to communicate with computers globally because they use networking protocols. 
        Similarly, for a computer to connect to the internet to send and receive data each computer requires an IP address and over a network a computer needs to another computers IP address to send or receive data otherwise, the computer will not know which computer to send the data. Sections of IP addresses are organized by region and location of the computer so other computers can know which network to connect to and which IP addresses to communicate with. The internet has expanded rapidly as Paola explains. “IPV4 it was designed in 1973 and widely adopted in the early 80s and provides more than 4 billion unique addresses for devices connecting to the internet… and 4 Billion addresses wont be enough we’re now in the middle of a multiyear transition to a longer IP address format called IPV6”(3:28-3:55 Paola) Likewise, IP addresses work together with DNS to link the internet to computers across the world, DNS enables an IP address to be associated with a website link that a person on the internet can access.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="second-card-text"><i>The way internet users can send and receive information is through a packet system where data is split into smaller pieces and sent across the internet.
        However, some parts of the internet are used more frequently which causes the internet packet to assess where is the fastest possible route so it can deliver the information without taking the slower route.
        Moreover, when data is transmitted across a network an internet router can receive that information and enable computer users to access, send, and observe data online.
        Similarly, if a network needs to send more information then more routers should be added to make it easier to send data across a network.</i></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"> How the internet works part 5 HTML and HTTP</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
      When computers want to access the internet a computer sends a request to access a website. The website’s server sends back the web-page the person wants to access.
        Likewise, web browsers enable people to access the internet by inputting text in the browser’s search box and the web browser uses a search engine to find the results the person wants to browse.
        Moreover, websites primarily use HTML which is universally used on most websites to format the website’s text and graphics.
        Moreover, it is important to take the size of a website into consideration otherwise web-pages could load slower or load incompletely if the files on the web-page are too large.
        Therefore, the files are difficult to send to another computer that wants to see the website.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="second-card-text"><i>When data is sent online it is within a person’s best interest to verify that the data is secure and encrypted to prevent illicit hackers from accessing their personal information.
        Encryption is when data is changed so only authorized users can see the file. Likewise, Mia Gil Epner a computer science major states the importance of complex data encryption. Mia states “Today’s secure communications are encrypted using 256 bit keys….even if you had a hundred thousand super computers and each of them was able to try a million billion keys every second it would take trillions of trillions of trillions of years to try every option.”(3:00-3:32) Mia Gil Epner.
        Likewise, it is critical to ensure data is secure so a user does not have to be a victim of a cyber attack.
        Moreover, it is important for online services to use encryption to prevent hackers from obtaining that does not belong to them.
        Similarly, encryption also works with decryption keys which can enable certain people to access data.
        A public key can encrypt data, but only people with a private key can read the data.</i></p>
