            <h5 class="card-title"> History of the Internet Web Browsers</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The internet is a critical aspect of modern communications in the early internet there were numerous web browser services that struggled to compete for market dominance. Moreover, early web browser creator Marc Andreessen was a Netscape co-founder which was responsible for enhancing an average person’s web browsing experience. Likewise, Andreessen and his web development team created Mosaic the earliest web browser with a user friendly graphical user interface.
                Likewise, Jim Clark heavily invested in expanding Mosaic and making it widely available. However, Mosaic was extremely difficult to market because Jim Clark was the only investor the Mosaic development team had at the time. Meanwhile, other leaders in the technology industry such as Bill Gates Microsoft's co-founder wanted to create a web browsing experience wholly dominated by Microsoft. Therefore, Bill Gates actively competed against Netscape by introducing its own MSN service for computers. Moreover, Microsoft tried to intimidate Netscape by holding a meeting with it’s employees and made an aggressive offer to buy Netscape’s resources so Microsoft would no longer have competition against them. “In August 1995”(26:20 John Heilemann) Netscape chose to be publicly listed on stock exchange platforms, to collect funding to enhance it’s products. Netscape’s initial public offering made Netscape extremely wealthy which instigated Microsoft to create and release the internet explorer browser. Moreover, Microsoft created aggressive competition when they made internet explorer available for free, which caused Netscape to be used less often because people had to buy Netscape to use it. However, Microsoft’s aggressive business strategies were effective and usage of the Netscape browser had fallen drastically and they were acquired by AOL. Furthermore, “its 1998 and the United States Department of Justice...has launched a historic antitrust lawsuit.”(38:24 John Heilemann) Microsoft was being scrutinized by legal experts and the department of Justice for using unlawful business strategies to unfairly gain market dominance and cause companies like Netscape to be absorbed into other companies or possibly face closure because they could no longer freely compete in the internet browser industry. The Judge found Bill Gates guilty in the trial and caused Microsoft’s stock market value to plummet.
                It is critical for software companies like Netscape to be able to compete freely to create an even competitive market. Likewise, it is important to prevent immense companies like Microsoft from using their financial resources to create campaigns to remove smaller competitors like Netscape from being able to compete and sell their products to the general public.</p>

                <p class="second-card-text"><i>Prior to modern search engines organizing billions of web pages into a convenient easy to read format people using the early internet in the mid 1990s had to manually search for web pages which made browsing the internet strenuous until the founders of Yahoo Jerry Yang and David Filo created the first easy to use search engine. Moreover, Yahoo’s largest competitor was excite founded by Joe Kraus it was technologically superior than Yahoo because the websites Yahoo has listed on their platform were manually indexed. However, the websites Excite displayed were automatically indexed by a program. Moreover, after Yahoo and Excite have solidified dominance in the search engine industry Google started at Stanford university and expanded quickly. Moreover, Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were approached by Vinod Khosla who wanted Excite to borrow Google’s indexing program to improve on Excite’s web page indexing. However, Excite declined to work with Google which was a missed financial opportunity because Google is more commonly used than Excite and has a larger market value. Google was able to rapidly expand it’s operations because wealthy investors like Andy Bechtolsheim invested large sums of money into Google. “So I rushed out to my car and pull out my checkbook and wrote them a check on the spot.”(Andy Bechtolsheim 22:53-22:57 ) “He came back with a checkbook and wrote us a check for 100,000 dollars.”(Sergey Brin 22:54-22:59) However, Google struggled to make revenue, but Bill Gross figured out how to make ad revenue without cluttering a search engine menu with banner ads that could annoy internet users. Gross’ technique was to gather the internet searches of the people using the internet, store that data, and would use keywords purchased by companies that would like to advertise using Gross’ system to sway internet users to buy their product. Despite the skepticism from Gross’ staff members at a meeting. Gross states. “Come its just like the yellow pages...Think how useful the yellow pages are...Look how useful this is. Why wouldn't that be helpful?” (Gross31:30-31:52) Google studied Gross’ keyword advertising and adapted into the Google search engine and became massively successful and wealthy. Moreover, Google in the long term has outgrown Yahoo, Excite, and Bill Gross’ company IdeaSpace, because of wealthy venture capitalists investing money into Google. Likewise, Google has made browsing the internet easier and more convenient than search engines like Excite and Yahoo because their advertising is not interrupting a user’s web browsing experience.
