            <h5 class="card-title">History of the Internet People</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The internet has changed how people can communicate with other groups of people. Likewise, the internet has expanded immensely due to the extremely high demand for accessing and using the internet. Likewise, major companies like Yahoo, Google, Amazon, eBay, Digg, and Facebook, have made the internet more accessible to the general public. For example, Google and Yahoo indexed internet web pages so users could find what they would like to see online quickly. Moreover, companies like Facebook have made the internet even more popular than it already was by creating a successful social media website. Moreover, websites like Youtube have also redefined entertainment because the general public has the option to watch entertaining content on the internet. Moreover, Digg popularized the concept of users deciding what articles gets featured on their social media news article hybrid website. Likewise, Digg’s casual atmosphere is what made it popular among people on the internet because the user has voting power to what gets featured. However, what also popularized the internet was when Apple opened Itunes to the internet so users can purchase music. Purchasing music digitally through Itunes was extremely effective for Apple because Itunes had support from many music producers. Therefore, Apple was able to generate revenue from music sales which was shared between Apple and the music producers. Moreover, other services on the internet such as Craigslist have also changed the internet because Craigslist is not immensely profitable like google or Facebook, but also provides services similar to eBay where users can buy and sell products online.
                The Internet through it’s early development in the 1960s has changed drastically since it was made available to general public in the early 1990s. Moreover, the internet has brought numerous positive social changes because the general public can search for online products, communicate with other people, and browse the internet through organized web search engines like google using a computer or other internet connected devices.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">History of the Internet Dot Com Bubble</h5>
                <p class="second-card-text"><i>During the Internet's development to monetize it numerous companies began figuring out how to monetize internet content besides advertising. The earliest major e-commerce websites Amazon and eBay found out how to effectively sell products online and began popularizing online shopping. “Bezos launched amazon in the summer of 1995”(John Heilemann 3:18-3:21) Likewise, Pierre Omidyar launched eBay on a similar time and became Bezos’ first competitor in e-commerce. Moreover, Amazon and eBay were tremendously successful in their early stages similar to the success stories of Google and Yahoo the details of their success were covered in the previous historical summary. During the increase of e-commerce transactions in the 1990s and 2000s it created the need for better cybersecurity innovations to protect e-commerce customer’s data during online transactions. Encrypting user data when a transaction is submitted creates secure payments for e-commerce users and sellers. Likewise, what contributed to the dot com bubble was when newly founded companies like eBay went public and many people began investing in their shares. Likewise, other newly created companies struggled to remain profitable because they spent excessive sums of money on unnecessary events. Philip Kaplan States. “People were just spending crazy amounts of money... they spent 10 million dollars on their launch party. they raised 12 million and spent 10 million on the party.”(Kaplan 24:18)  John Doerr also makes an insightful statement about how many new e-commerce companies made terrible business decisions. “Very energetic nearly frantic time when it was easy to lose your bearings and some of your judgment.”(Doerr 25:43-25:53) Likewise, after the dot com bubble burst many e-commerce companies went bankrupt because they had spent their investors money and were not profitable enough to repay their expenses. Likewise, when the dot com bubble burst it redefined e-commerce and now modern tech companies are more cautious to they do not risk going bankrupt over bad business decisions.
